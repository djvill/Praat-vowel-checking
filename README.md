# Praat-vowel-checking
Spiffy utilities for speedy checking of vowel measurements in Praat


TODO for repo (not for file itself)

* Add a wee bit of intro text (maybe with a sweet screengrab GIF)

* Add vignette for how to make this stuff work nicely with LaBB-CAT R package

* Add some sample files

* At some point, add Correct_Formant_Settings.praat
